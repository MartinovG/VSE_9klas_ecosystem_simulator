# Ecosystem Simulator

The Ecosystem Simulator is a Python program that simulates the dynamics of a virtual ecosystem, including plants, herbivores, and predators. It provides a visual representation of the ecosystem and allows you to observe the interactions between different entities.

## Features

- **Plants**: The simulation includes various plants that grow and reproduce over time.
- **Herbivores**: Herbivores roam the ecosystem, consuming plants for energy and reproducing.
- **Predators**: Predators hunt herbivores for sustenance and also reproduce.
- **Environmental Factors**: The simulator takes into account factors such as temperature and humidity that affect the behavior and survival of plants, herbivores, and predators.
- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the simulation by placing tornadoes to observe its impact on the ecosystem.
- **Real-time Updates**: The simulation provides real-time updates on the status and changes happening within the ecosystem.
