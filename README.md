# Ecosystem Simulator

The Ecosystem Simulator is a Python program that simulates the dynamics of a virtual ecosystem, including plants, herbivores, and predators. It provides a visual representation of the ecosystem and allows you to observe the interactions between different entities.

## Features

- **Plants**: The simulation includes various plants that grow and reproduce over time.
- **Herbivores**: Herbivores roam the ecosystem, consuming plants for energy and reproducing.
- **Predators**: Predators hunt herbivores for sustenance and also reproduce.
- **Environmental Factors**: The simulator takes into account factors such as temperature and humidity that affect the behavior and survival of plants, herbivores, and predators.
- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the simulation by placing tornadoes to observe its impact on the ecosystem.
- **Real-time Updates**: The simulation provides real-time updates on the status and changes happening within the ecosystem.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
```
git clone https://github.com/MartinovG/VSE_9klas_ecosystem_simulator.git
```
2. Install Python
3. Install the required dependencies
```
pip install pygame
```
```
pip install random
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file:
```
py main.py
```

2. Use the mouse to interact with the simulation. You can modify environmental factors.

3. Press the "Begin" button to start the simulation and observe the ecosystem dynamics in real-time.

4.You can see graph about living plants, herbivores and predators as a result of the simulation by clicking the button "Graph"
